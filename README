SLD stands for simple linker
SLD is a DCPU-16 linker for SOF format object files. It supports SOF
but can be easily extended to support other formats.
SLD stands for simple linker. It outputs binaries from object files.

It supports the ORG directive through commmand line argument --org <address>

It should compile on all UNIX operating systems and on Windows with MinGW.

TODO:
other more advanced object format support
cooperation with ORG directives (not yet supported by SAS)

It is entirely written in C and released under the GPLv2.

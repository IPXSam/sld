SLD stands for simple linker
SLD is a DCPU-16 linker for SOF format object files. It supports SOF
but can be easily extended to support other formats.
SLD stands for simple linker. It outputs binaries from object files.

It supports the ORG directive through commmand line argument --org <address>
HOWEVER this only needs to be specified either in the assembler or the
linker, NOT on both e.g. --org 0x200 on assembler + --org 0x200 on linker
means binary expects to be loaded at 0x400.

It suppors relocation tables through the command line option --relocation.
Read the file RELOC_TABLES for more information

It should compile on all UNIX operating systems and on Windows with MinGW.

TODO:
other more advanced object format support

It is entirely written in C and released under the GPLv2.

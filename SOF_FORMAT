The first section "symbols" contains the symbol identifier to the left
and the respective value to the right (separated by a space). Each
symbol and respective value go on their own line. The next section is
the binary section, which contains the binary words in text format and
hex format, as well as symbol references which are actually refered to
by their identifiers (e.g. 0x8c01 print_screen ...). The binary
section goes on 1 line, with the next line being the "end" which marks
the last section of the simple object file format.

NOTE:only the symbols: and end part of the object file are mandatory.
This is to allow for object files that are simple references for
library linking.

The previous header and this sentence are not part of the object design.
symbols:
<symbolname> <value>
...
binary:
0x<hex> 0x<hex> <symbol reference> 0x<hex> ...
end
